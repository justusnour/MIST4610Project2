## Describing the Dataset and What It Contains
The dataset used for this project is titled “Hate Crimes by County and Bias Type, Beginning 2010.” It was obtained from the U.S. Data.gov open data portal and published by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services.
This dataset provides annual counts of reported hate crime incidents, victims, and offenders in New York State, organized by county, year, and bias motivation. The bias categories include race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, and other demographic characteristics. The data begins in 2010 and extends through recent years, allowing for meaningful trend and comparison analysis.
At the time of analysis, the dataset contained 822 rows (observations) and 44 columns (variables). Each row represents the number of hate crimes recorded in a specific county and year, separated into “Crimes Against Persons” and “Property Crimes.”
The key columns and their data types are summarized below:
County: The name of the New York county where the hate crime occurred (String).


- Year: The reporting year of the incident (Integer).


- Crime Type: Categorizes the offense as “Crimes Against Persons” or “Property Crimes” (String).


- Anti-Male / Anti-Female / Anti-Transgender / Anti-Gender Non-Conforming: Number of reported crimes motivated by gender or gender identity bias (Integer).


- Anti-White / Anti-Black / Anti-Asian / Anti-American Indian, etc.: Counts of hate crimes motivated by racial bias (Integer).


- Anti-Jewish / Anti-Catholic / Anti-Islamic (Muslim) / Anti-Other Religion, etc.: Counts of crimes motivated by religious bias (Integer).


- Anti-Hispanic / Anti-Arab / Anti-Other Ethnicity: Counts of crimes motivated by ethnicity or national origin (Integer).


- Anti-Gay Male / Anti-Gay Female / Anti-Bisexual / Anti-Heterosexual: Counts of crimes motivated by sexual orientation bias (Integer).


- Anti-Physical Disability / Anti-Mental Disability: Counts of hate crimes targeting individuals with disabilities (Integer).


- Total Incidents: Total number of hate crime incidents recorded for that county, year, and crime type (Integer).


- Total Victims: Total number of victims involved in those incidents (Integer).


- Total Offenders: Total number of known offenders (Integer).


This dataset provides a clear overview of hate crime activity across New York State counties beginning in 2010. Because it includes multiple bias categories, it allows for the exploration of questions such as:
How the frequency of hate crimes has changed over time.


Which bias types are most prevalent in certain regions.


How different counties compare in total incidents and types of bias.
Its moderate size (822 rows × 44 columns) makes it ideal for Tableau analysis and visual exploration, while still being detailed enough to produce meaningful and socially relevant insights.
